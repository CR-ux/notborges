## LAST NIGHT'S DREAM

in the dream, i was as an insect being crushed beneath a collage of concrete 
still in my human form, or so i was to think for whatever time i'd had left there
i had fallen asleep inside my nightmare to find another 
and there in a vehicle we were being packed into, the city was metastasising 
people were dying, everywhere 
people all dying everywhere 
why are there people dying everywhere and why am i simply writing these little words 
while people are dying everywhere
and in the dream i was so afraid i was to die 
and in this dream i wake into somehow i know i am afraid to die like i'm supposed to 
and i've not been dying the way i was born to 
and in the dream on this bus, or in this car or metal cube; we were all terrified there, these people i never knew 
and they were there, the one i thought i did | we were separated into two groups, for the purposes of some investigation 
and we had been driven back to the scene of some crime we were told was over 
only to find a burning mess of bodies, of men still stabbing and shooting one another, 
they were all killing one another-- they were all dying and the flames they birthed refused to 
and we were ducking beneath our transparency, underneath the traitor of the car windows 
and i found myself thanking my hips for dislocating in a certain way, affording my evasion by my familiar lowness 
and i was holding my breath in that car, feeling the heat of the explosives bursting into an ending life of their own; 
and praying, somehow, in that dream, to the god that must too have been sleeping; 
and i wondered why we had to park so near, and i wondered why they were all dying
and i was certain we were to die soon 
the one who kicked me into this dream was the only one i knew there, save my familiar, who was darting into corners of this car, away from view, the fear of his pain greater than even my own undoing 
and eventually, the car pulling away allowed me to look for him, and i found him, needing to pull him from a compressed knot of bodies like a root from the earth; 
and he came out into my hands in parts, and i had to repeat this process, in a hell, in a hell, in the sun of a hell of my son dying, dying, this dying it is as a Sun 
it is the sun I dance around 

and on the way to a home with which i  was not familiar, all of this agony, this threat and this unravelled gore of my sweetest love, on the other side of a membrane to my greatest sorrow; i had to swallow my vomit countless times, as i was told i couldn't leave my DNA anywhere, for they would find me, they would find me and all of this would have been for nothing 

but we were let out of the vehicle then, in a sprawling cityscape, with bodies, alive and dead, packed tighter, even tighter than in the car, and i again was clutching Borges to my chest, whatever was left of him, thinking somehow in the dream that i could grow him back like a seed, like a tended flower grows back in the spring -- and by this time all i had left were his two small front teeth, and the chew of his gum that still held them together. 
and i hate my sleeping wax of the crack of my mind 
for pulling all my worst fears into waking; 
where there in this hell i had to climb over these bodies, in some structure akin to an amphitheatre- a girl helped me climb over the railings, and i dropped his little teeth, what was left of my love i dropped in the struggle, and found myself screaming and running my hands over rotting flesh and leaves, scraping through stench of trash left on the flecks of  dusty pavement, rare exposed patches where i begged to find his teeth; knowing that he was gone, whatever futile hope i'd had to grow back the warmness of his little body 

and in the dream i bent my raw and bleeding throat silenced of its screams upward, to the crest of these crystal waves of blocks of building after building and i saw the only window of sky to peer through; 
and it was shrinking, no, digging further into itself, framed by the edges of the towers, like a mirror wars with another, like a corridor born from such a battle; 
and i knew that iw as in a dream then; 
i was unthinkable fathoms deep inside a ladder of skies 
and stabbed bodies and writhing agonies of souls 
stretched across a canvas of my own memory, flimsy plastic 
parading as the hopeless glass 
of a picture frame now emptied 
and in i was sent, back to the car; where, still a fraction, but a greater fraction of my loved one's body still remained, and i began the search again
my lucidity not a balm, but a wretched curse of knowing -- i felt perhaps i had been in this vehicle of vehicles for centuries; 
and i could not wake but i was the waking, and the waking was the hell, and the waking was the form that had been ripped and shot and stabbed and taken 
and i was the two teeth left as the seeds of an unripe melon, and i was the buildings, and i was never to be a sky, but a mirror 


and soon, or later, or millions of lifetimes ago, or never; 
there i somehow repeated the necessary task, like a worm pulls its sorry body through the filth 
knowing the glass at the boundary, and the greedy eyes still attached to hands that pushed its home into unforgiving geometry, 
no thought of the curves of its splittable atomic body 
i was then in my childhood home where my piano had not yet been given away 
and my abuser's parents were outside, waiting 
waiting for me to come outside and join them in another car, filled with his family 
and my familiar was not there anymore 
and i wondered then if that's who has been following me 
if these teeth i'm holding onto have something left to feed them 
or sink into 
and what had changed from this early street; 
and my murals were covering the neighbours houses 
and my mother was starting to cook the carcass of a chicken 
impaling on a pike, to set it alight, as if this was a given; 
it was so easy for her, pushing this splintering stake, into a sorry forgiveness
a giving way of wood, un-knocking its forgotten footsteps

and i'd tried to search for some reliable source that supported her claim 
to burn the follicle protrusions of the bird,
its smoothness as a requisite 
for devouring-- a betrayal of the skin, a vomit, unswallowable.
to feed her hungry family 

and my first hell in human form, or maybe my last, he was shaking his head at every idea for a gift i'd had for his family 
and in this dream i was a brick 
and in this dream i was able to fit into a car 
and in this dream i had nothing 
i had nothing to give but the glass of  a picture frame 
as i was sent back inside, and blamed for being late; 
to some unknown destination, a celebration of some forgotten family 
and there that man, that little boy sat shaking his head, nearly laughing 
at the insufficiency of it 

i do not know what happened in the middling, 
and what monsters slept inside the bed of its soon silence 
i only know the sky looked back without a smile 
in some sort of disgust at my clawing longing to see more of it 
at my indolence of innocence and my 
incessant need to know what threat 
was next; 
and where my child was dying 
into the death of language 
trying, just reaching for some door 
that might let another's hearing in--

as if it was so selfish just to want the remnants of 
the speck of dust i had been left with 
the semblance of reminding 
of my skin cell of a message 
of the mangle of my vehicle 
the holding of my vomit 
the others in that car, how crushing--
in the dream i was just the knowing of a crowd 
now doomed to see in one another
their end 
in the dream i was every beginning 
i had presented to a snoring god 
like a child attempting to emulate their bedtime stories 
in the dream i was made to sleep on the pillowed sail 
of atrophying muscle unbecoming 

and when pulled back to the burning sardine city,
the destination that began at the house i grew up in
brought back to that war, and that mirror sky 
we had been led into a safehouse, 
or a concentration camp once more 
and i saw around me tin foil trays, to feed us 
and it seemed i had landed in an iteration ending 
with no single sign of the body of my child 
searching amongst these tattered rations 
ferrets, like my little one, cut into slices, and served up in sections 
on beds of whatever vegetation survived the endless blasts 
and there i felt a sopping weight at my neck, a heaviness of promise 
i pulled a blueing corpse's hand 
from out of my spine, 
i pulled my death from what was left of my childish life 
i pulled the punchline from my waste 
cold, soft, useless;
like it was a ribbon of bubblegum 
i pulled myself from the binding of my Story
