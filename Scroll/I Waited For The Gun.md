## LAST NIGHT'S DREAM

then as always in my dream last night, my sister, not biological but by spirit, was halfway up a stony hill; having sex with her brother. 
I fell downward to the bottom of it, like Jill, and a gigantic spider descended onto me, it was terrifying. 
There at the bottom of the slope, this steep steep slope, I spoke to my earliest love and childhood friend, Ruth, a christian --
Where then, Her God would be my God;
I spoke to her of what had transpired since our parting nearly thirty years ago. Through an inexplicable window; bordered by wooden beams;
We shared our stories and cried, Pyramus and Thisbe through this glassing membrane. There was somehow an unspeakable tactility to our lack of touch;
In the building to the left of this hill I apparently was involved in some infernal game, with a group of people, focussed around the formation of definition, ferociously battling against one another in a war of the words. 
In the recesses of the game, its interstices, we were told to reveal any secrets we had ascertained about the other team, to incriminate them and call into question the veracity of their lexicography.
One of the women of the opposing team, had been involved in a much more traumatic game, in a sequence occurring parallel to this one, on the same sleepless, nightmarish night. A tinfoil mirror, scratched from the scrubbing grate of iron wool.
In this nightmare, a group of us, perhaps a subset, perhaps the entirety, were involved in a Battle Royale, as i so often am in dreams. 
In this series of survival games, occurring within and on the front lawn of my first abuser's parents' house, we were to complete a number of menial tasks, the actions of which were not deadly in themselves, our involvement almost arbitrary; merely threatened at gunpoint, knifepoint, scissorpoint, to complete them or face certain, agonising death. 
Inside the house, where the sequence initiated, the scene was relatively benign -- we had arrived at the house to visit my ex's parents, these characters from a past life; and in this house where I was searching for various objects from my current life, there was a cast of characters arriving in a strange and confusing party that carried suspiciously dark and nefarious undertones. 
Eventually, I had realised that my schoolfriend, the driver of the vehicle that had brought us there, had in fact stolen these objects for whjich i was searching, searching for, and I just couldn't let go of -- these objects preventing my eventual escape from the hell that would follow. 
I remember searching for one of my shoes; a pair of shoes I had long forgotten I owned, and loved, and thought were gone forever. I had found the left one of what was left of them, perhaps repaired by my cobbler father -- But I just could not, for the literal life of me, find the right one. 
This aforementioned woman, a devout fundamentalist christian, was bent upon converting us all to her limited and oppressive beliefs (and this, in the Word Games, would be my proof that she was not to be trusted as a source of Truth). When I had grown weary and fearful of the harm she was causing the other members of the group, I started to fight back in conversation, telling her how gargantuan, how heavily hurtful her little words were. And I could sense her anger, and somehow, the anger not only of the guests of the party, of the house's owners, but of the *house itself* -- as if the walls were searing hot, searing hot around the boundaries of my searching. 
And the woman began to scream, and ragefully retort, until I'd reached some sort of inevitable and inarguable conclusion -- 
at which point, her pupils dilated monstrously; and her eyes turned inside out of themselves, and I was so afraid of what this meant. Her silence was more terrifying that the noise she had insisted on making prior. 
And then began the Death Games; where we were handed flimsy tinfoil trays, caked with hardened masses of food, presumably discarded by members of the party enjoying their drinks and laughing maniacally within the house we now found ourselves on the front porch of. 
We were told to scrub the trays; and once completed, we were to hold onto them for dear life; to collect another from the armed soldiers holding us hostage and threatening death; beating us, silencing us with their unsilenced weapons-- 
The soldier assigned to my undoing handed me too many trays in error; and I could see that this had given me an advantage. 
But I distributed them equally amongst the other 'players' -- I didn't feel right, I felt only guilt for my increased chance of survival. And yet, in spite of or despite this, the other players descended on me, and tried to take the final, singular tray that I held in my hands. I clung to it, pleading, weeping, wailing and wondering why on earth they had turned on me when all I'd tried to do was bring as many of us to safety as possible; why now they seemed resolved to bring about my end. 
As always, As always in my dreams, I crawled through the dirt, holding my mangled foil in one hand and dragging my body as far as I could in futility away from an inescapable death.
As always in my dreams, I felt it, I felt the heart of it looming like angry walls--
As always, I waited; and it came, and I didn't wake;
I died 
As always in my dreams I waited for what came after the pain, after the sodden wet of earth I fell into, 
As always in my dreams I waited for the ending of the dream, 
I waited for the blood to leave the bulletwound 
And even after the gunshot, as always, bleeding--
As always in my dreams--
I waited for the gun 
but last night i remember you being halfway up this steep it's coming back now FUCK there was this horrible dream i'd forgotten about having, years ago, and i was desperately trying to find the other one so we could just leave and escape this hell, but then realised my old school friend had purposely brought so many objects from my own house, in order to keep me trapped here, searching, searching for the things i couldn‚Äôt leave behind, keeping me tethered to this horrible place that among as many players as i could and i just had one left, wishing i'd just hidden them, wishing i'd just kept them for myself and my own survival; because now i was the most disadvantaged of all, and the games were in the front garden of this angry house, and i remember trying to go back in, where one of my shoes were, but there stood a woman with scissors, trying to stab me should i enter, to find these shoes which i'd forgotten about having, years ago, and i was desperately trying to find the other one so we could just leave and escape this hell, but then realised my old school friend had purposely brought so many objects from my own house, in order to keep me trapped here, searching, searching for the things i couldn't leave behind as many players i could and i just had one left, wishing i'd just hidden them, wishing i'd just kept them for myself and my own survival; because now i was the most disadvantaged of all, and the games were in the front garden of this angry, angry, hot and melted angry house, and i remember trying to go back in, where one of my shoes were, which i'd forgotten about having, years ago, and i was desperately trying to find the other one so we could just leave and escape this hell, as always in my dreams i was waiting but then realised my old school friend had purposely brought so many objects frommy own house, in order to keep me trapped as always in my dreams here, searching, searching for the things i couldn't leave behind, keeping me tethered to this horrible place that as always was to be my end--  and
