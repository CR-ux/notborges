# THE SEA

the sea is singing 
saying in its breath:

i am sorry i cant fix the bruise, the dose 
hold you in the heavy ways you wanted 
i can't wash away any of the inside 
or make your mum call back earlier 

the clouded sky had said then i am sorry 
that i had to let you go 
i am sorry that the longing for your body 
can't make your work be held by those who need it 
yet,
i asked them, could they tell my mum 
i am sorry i moved so far away 
whatever water falls to all the gravity i ignored 
was my children, they are singing

an egg cracked, and wondered why nothing came out of it
but i was there still, listening, to its breaking 
like a wave 
in blood, in vain, in endless undried paintings 
that the egg had made, for the yolk it wanted to become

and the sand it landed on replied 
but i was the gospel to a
god that had to let me go 
i was the song that sang at bridges 
singing to the beat of change
falling softly into hats 
i was the music with a rhythm, beaten 
dancing--
round the fire, leaving 
soot and ash in shapes of dancing 
bones for dancing, bones for drumming 



the pyre was lost then, but the leaves were singing how they had forgiven all the trees
who had to let them go 
for else they would have never lived.
i sighed, to someone, like an organ
a body who might hold this much too late 
and sit at my keys 
like a family table:

i am forever in your art and will
live as long as the fire
that burns your heart to make it 

this body is the work of living 
and dying taught me everything 
there was no body made to hold
or hold mine, in the evening 
drowsing, rousing, or 
dowsing ore, how all the oar of all this
story left 
a river unforgiving 

i was the children
i could never hold 
i do not what to die 
until some body holds my body 
of work this story to them i wrote
myself out of to hold 
this book if they could 
not hold me

there was a voice then, finally 
saying
i was the children
i was the music
i was the song 
i was the book i wrote myself out of
and i was this little story 
that read to me, one bedtime:

Never be afraid to cry 
the sea is grateful for the salt
