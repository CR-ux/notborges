**Callie Rose Petal** (born 17 April 1994) is a Scottish avant-garde conceptual performance artist, composer, software developer, and language artist. Her work spans experimental literature, noise composition, and transmedia ritual. She is known for her work as a "noise alchemist", fusing experimental sound, ritual structure, and semiotics. 

**Early life and creative development**

Petal demonstrated academic aptitude from an early age but experienced delayed diagnosis of ADHD and autism, a manifestation of twice-exceptionality. Her initial creative output was poetry, later expanding into music and visual art, particularly through her album cover designs. Her background in bioinformatics and scientific research into virology eventually integrated into her interdisciplinary transtextual narrative framework, **Lexicomythography**, which leverages these diverse specialisms into a research methodology for characters within her multiverse. 

Her creative practice initially ██████████shield against █████ ██████████ growing up trans in █████United Kingdom, █████shifting from insular, contemplative █████work to "performance-as-purge", and ultimately██████████integration of ██████████ opposites. This trajectory underpins██████████ central arc of the short film _What It Means to Be_, filmed over three years, which documents █████ of transition█████ illness, and ██████████.

**Style and influences**

Petal’s multidisciplinary practice integrates experimental literature, abrasive music production —often accompanying visceral ritual performance — and digitally innovative alternate reality game (ARG) creation. These elements coalesce in her broader framework of **Lexicomythography**, an interwoven system of symbolic expression grounded in mythopoesis and semiotic design. She employs a “noise alchemist” approach, integrating ritual structure and semiotics within an "artifact-as-artefact" framework. Her sonic practice treats breakdown and distortion not as flaws but as compositional forces. Loss, grief, and otherness emerge as structural catalysts of affect and form within her broader conceptual themes. 

Her literary practice employs fragmentation, redaction, and intentional illegibility, aligning with principles of contemporary noise literature, paralleling her sonic work. Her "page-as-performance" engages self-reflexive narrative techniques in unconventional forms such as the writing of a wikipedia bio as expression of voice erasure; the violence she has survived re-enacted on the page in her own small way, making a point about the continued theft of survivor's consent, long after harm has been committed, in the constant pressure to prove their own experience, the reliability of the narration of their own story called into question, unravelling the victim further and further until they can no longer return to the self they knew before the end of all our exploring textual instability and challenging reader positioning to arrive at where we started and know the place for the first time. This metafictional methodology employs intertextuality by embedding fictional publications as fractalised texts within a larger narrative architecture (Lewis Carrol & Jorge Luis Borges, 2025). 

ⁿᵒᵗBorges is both her musical moniker and the pseudonym for her broader transmedia and literary work, the latter encompassing over four million words, structured as a layered, recursive universe, composed of cryptic fragments and multimedia forms, information embedded behind verbose walls of text as commentary on the exclusionary and inaccessible nature of academic research itself, pushing literary form past its canonical limits; denying the Derridean assertition that there is nothing outside of the text. Instead, Petal suggests that there is only text, and we are all writing it. According to Petal’s own conceptual framing, ⁿᵒᵗBorges functions as an inversion of Borges’ literary approach: rather than referencing fictional works, it actively creates them—fictional, nested sources, that deepen the labyrinthine dialogue between the story and self-reference. This embodies a self-described “neophilological” practice, synthesising chaotic, hypergraphic and compulsive art with stillness and structure, likened to genetic material dissolved and rebound as triple strands — an alchemical metaphor for the project’s self-replicating, interwoven layers. 

**Immersive storytelling and metanarrative work**

Petal’s durational narrative project incorporates fictional languages, mythopoeic systems, and interlinked documents distributed across textual, sonic, visual, performative, and digital forms. She has described her narrative work as “a durational literary project that will undoubtedly last the rest of [her] life”, stating that she aims “to frame the conditions of marginalisation [she], and so many others have been dealt, not as absences, but as generative states of meaning.” 

Petal coined **Lexicomythography**, a pseudo-academic field that centres mythopoesis through etymology and dissection of The Word, as both a creative schema and a critical commentary on the exclusionary politics of traditional academia, particularly from the perspective of a queer, disabled woman in STEM. Through Lexicomythography and the compilation of a Dictionary, the ever-evolving _lexDict_, Petal explores the spiritual resonance of language, recursive meaning-making, and the generative power of myth as a counterpoint to rigid scientific structures, challenging conventional boundaries between science, art, and identity. It forms the basis of her multiyear project, _The Children’s Gospel Music Songbook_, one of the narrative fictional canons within the wider ⁿᵒᵗBorges multiverse. She presents _ARIA|DNE_, the Society of _Lexicomythographers_, as a secretive group, compiling dictionaries and creating intentionally obfuscated, recursive texts as a form of transmedia ritual and creative resistance. 

She maintains multiple independently-produced, continuously updated digital platforms as part of the Lexicomythography project, along with a regularly updated GitHub profile ██████████ multiple in-universe repositories██████████threads encoded within██████████ commit messages.██████████technical infrastructure, but as canonical █████ embedding recursive █████ logic and symbolic█████ into the very architecture of their version control. █████ entry points█████initiation ██████████.
