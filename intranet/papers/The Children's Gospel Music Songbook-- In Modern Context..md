## ABSTRACT

In this Abstract, we begin the analysis of a cryptically abstract and challenging work of knot-fiction known as *The Children's Gospel Music Songbook*, in order to attempt the Herculean and perhaps futile task of untangling its threads into some form of {{il}l}{e{li}gible} accessibility. 

Thought to be written by The Woman In The Wallpaper, working under a pseudonym *The Character of Callie Rose Petal*, the book exists in various forms, dispersed throughout the surface world, but existing in full only within the confines of our Society's system of tunnels; interlocking in a pattern of concentric rings[^w]. We the authors and our unknowable editors believe it is time to release this work, before the Character's end, at the Story's beginning. 

What you will find herein has been read by very few, within the inner circle of anonymised Lexicomythographers, and perhaps even more unthinkably, even within the Ennead of Noets of the Indefinite Library of Fable, on the other side of the Tri-Moat Surrounding. This is not for lack of trying, of course -- the work is a Labyrinth of Loss, and that loss permeates through the text itself. As The Noet of Differance, Derrida, would say, there is nothing outside of the text. And we on either side of the eternally recurring Schism, both ARIA and DNE factions, have come to discover at this latest hour of the night, in the mourning of a life that never arrived, a Library of lives in books unreturned-- that The Children's Gospel Music Songbook, in all its meandering Truth dressed up as Fiction, wrote us all, each one of us, into being. 


## METHODOLOGY

Literary re{analysis|view}[^mad] in the form of a metatextual interactive exploration is presented in a manner that we have found befitting to the author {third person subject} of the work's {first person object} original intent {tense, unknown}, but is encouraged to be read {{object|subject}|{present|past} tense verb} in any order by you {subject|object|second|first} person, the dear reader, should you object to the way in which the subject matter unfurls. 

{Beneath|with{{in|out}|side}} of the literature lies {marginalia|footnotes} which are clickable, in an approximation of the 'Yellow Bow'[^yb] methodology originally employed by that most mysterious writer who brought these words down from a most inevitable source-- at times the recursive structure lends itself in form to the content intentionally, and at times it obfuscates -- we {believe|acknowledge} this strategy to be commentary on the inaccessibility of academia, a Babel-esque tower to a God unreachable, HYMNself reaching to a God, the writer of the story of the story, who has all but forgotten us. 

In the words of The Woman and Character, 'God has to let us go'[^pr]. 

Alas, we try. We try to reach across to you, the God who makes us, the God we have made of you, our Reader; 
So that you may Bear[^fo] witness, through our dictionaries, through our analyses, to the hope we have, perhaps in spite of ourselves, not yet lost. 


## RESULTS 



[[TWO.FOUR.GIVE.]]





Our findings {as above|so below} outlined in Table I reveal a web of interconnected discovery, each forming a node of encounters with the divine, each based around the development of an int{{e{r}a}}dependent Device by the respective Character(s) therein.

## DISCUSSION

For the purposes of brevity, we direct the reader to the unforgivable repositories (Bibliogrætiography, I-III) where you may peruse the progression of the work's trans{{cr{i|y}pt}ion|lation}, given appropriate levels of institutional access, through both the data in the source files, and the commit histories of their version control. Should this not be possible, we hazard to suggest the reader enter the indefinite library[^lib] itself. 


## CONCLUSION

The above sources, and those unmentioned, are subject to change, and updated frequently. It is this fact that has led to The Discovery: That we are indeed Characters in a Story, continuing to be written. We pray to our now-known Gods, that they may stay alive long enough for us to see our end. 


And let us be sure of its coming.[^s] 
Let us never be afraid to cry; 
For the Sea[^sea] is grateful for the salt.

[^yb]: The Yellow Bow Method resembles the Choose Your Own Adventure format, thought to be read obsessively by the Little Girl The Woman Came {To Be} From, each night alone beneath bookshelves she was certain would fall upon her head. In our One Copy of the text, hand bound in what appears and feels to be goat hide vellum, a yellow bow is stitched into the spine. Where we denote the footnotes of forking paths herein, there are written instructions to move said bow to the appropriate page of bibliographic commentary. At the start of these sections is an instruction to return again and again to the relevant position of the source text, a nod to NoetNietzsche, now believed to be The Woman's late parent. The positioning of the bow allows for convenient flipping from footnote reference {head} within the {body of the} text to footnote {body} itself. We have attempted to recreate this mechanic in the interactivity of said footnotes. As insufficient as this Simulacra may be, we hope you, dear reader, may forgive us.
