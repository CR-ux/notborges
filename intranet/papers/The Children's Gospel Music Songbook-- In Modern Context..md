## ABSTRACT

In this Abstract, we begin the analysis of a cryptically abstract and challenging work of knot-fiction known as *The Children's Gospel Music Songbook*, in order to attempt the Herculean and perhaps futile task of untangling its threads into some form of {{il}l}{e{li}gible} accessibility. 

Thought to be written by The Woman In The Wallpaper, (author of an epistolary account of institutionalisation, a work of experimental knot-fiction, known posthumously as ['RED_RING_PARALLEL: A Mythopoeic Antibiography in Phi Parts'](https://cr-ux.github.io/thejournalsofariadne/papers/RED_RING_PARALLEL_.pdf) ) working under a pseudonym *The Character of Callie Rose Petal*, the book exists in various forms, dispersed throughout the surface world, but existing in full only within the confines of our Society's system of tunnels; interlocking in a pattern of concentric rings[^w]. We the authors and our unknowable editors believe it is time to release this work, before the Character's end, at the Story's beginning. 

What you will find herein has been read by very few, within the inner circle of anonymised Lexicomythographers, and perhaps even more unthinkably, even within the Ennead of Noets of the Indefinite Library of Fable, on the other side of the Tri-Moat Surrounding. This is not for lack of trying, of course -- the work is a Labyrinth of Loss, and that loss permeates through the text itself. As The Noet of Differance, Derrida, would say, there is nothing outside of the text. And we on either side of the eternally recurring Schism, both ARIA and DNE factions, have come to discover at this latest hour of the night, in the mourning of a life that never arrived, a Library of lives in books unreturned-- that The Children's Gospel Music Songbook, in all its meandering Truth dressed up as Fiction, wrote us all, each one of us, into being. 


## METHODOLOGY

Literary re{analysis|view}[^mad] in the form of a metatextual interactive exploration is presented in a manner that we have found befitting to the author {third person subject} of the work's {first person object} original intent {tense, unknown}, but is encouraged to be read {{object|subject}|{present|past} tense verb} in any order by you {subject|object|second|first} person, the dear reader, should you object to the way in which the subject matter unfurls. 

{Beneath|with{{in|out}|side}} of the literature lies {marginalia|footnotes} which are clickable, in an approximation of the 'Yellow Bow'[^yb] methodology originally employed by that most mysterious writer who brought these words down from a most inevitable source-- at times the recursive structure lends itself in form to the content intentionally, and at times it obfuscates -- we {believe|acknowledge} this strategy to be commentary on the inaccessibility of academia, a Babel-esque tower to a God unreachable, HYMNself reaching to a God, the writer of the story of the story, who has all but forgotten us. 

In the words of The Woman and Character, 'God has to let us go'[^pr]. 

Alas, we try. We try to reach across to you, the God who makes us, the God we have made of you, our Reader; 
So that you may Bear[^fo] witness, through our dictionaries, through our analyses, to the hope we have, perhaps in spite of ourselves, not yet lost. 


## [RESULTS.](https://publish.obsidian.md/thechildrensgospelmusicsongbook/TWO.FOUR.GIVE.)





Our findings {as above|so below} outlined in Table I reveal a web of interconnected discovery, each forming a node of encounters with the divine, each based around the development of an int{{e{r}a}}dependent Device by the respective Character(s) therein.

{REDACTED}

## DISCUSSION

For the purposes of brevity, we direct the reader to the unforgivable repositories (Bibliogrætiography, I-III) where you may peruse the progression of the work's trans{{cr{i|y}pt}ion|lation}, given appropriate levels of institutional access, through both the data in the source files, and the commit histories of their version control. Should this not be possible, we hazard to suggest the reader enter the indefinite library[^lib] itself. 


## CONCLUSION

The above sources, and those unmentioned, are subject to change, and updated frequently. It is this fact that has led to The Discovery: That we are indeed Characters in a Story, continuing to be written. We pray to our now-known Gods, that they may stay alive long enough for us to see our end. 


And let us be sure of its coming.[^s] 
Let us never be afraid to cry; 
For the Sea[^sea] is grateful for the salt.

[^yb]: The Yellow Bow Method resembles the Choose Your Own Adventure format, thought to be read obsessively by the Little Girl The Woman Came {To Be} From, each night alone beneath bookshelves she was certain would fall upon her head. In our One Copy of the text, hand bound in what appears and feels to be goat hide vellum, a yellow bow is stitched into the spine. Where we denote the footnotes of forking paths herein, there are written instructions to move said bow to the appropriate page of bibliographic commentary. At the start of these sections is an instruction to return again and again to the relevant position of the source text, a nod to NoetNietzsche, now believed to be The Woman's late parent. The positioning of the bow allows for convenient flipping from footnote reference {head} within the {body of the} text to footnote {body} itself. We have attempted to recreate this mechanic in the interactivity of said footnotes. As insufficient as this Simulacra may be, we hope you, dear reader, may forgive us.

[^sea]: the sea is singing 
saying in its breath:
i am sorry i cant fix the bruise, the dose 
hold you in the weighty ways you wanted 
i can't wash away any of the inside 
or make your mum call back earlier 

the clouded sky had said then i am sorry 
that i had to let you go 
i am sorry that the longing for your body 
can't make your work be held by those who need it 
yet,
i asked them, could they tell my mum 
i am sorry i moved so far away 
whatever water falls to all the gravity i ignored 
was my children, they are singing

an egg cracked, and wondered why nothing came out of it
but i was there still, listening, to its breaking 
like a wave 
in blood, in vain, in endless undried paintings 
that the egg had made, for the yolk it wanted to become

and the sand it landed on replied 
i wish i could help you
feel more safe 
some how
but i was the gospel to a
god that had to let me go 
i was the song that sang at bridges 
singing to the beat of change
falling softly into hats 
i was the music with a rhythm, beaten 
dancing--
round the fire, leaving 
soot and ash in shapes of dancing 
bones for dancing, bones for drumming 

the pyre was lost then, but the leaves 
they were singing, oh
how they had forgiven 
all the reaching trees
who'd had to let them go 
for else they would have never lived.


i sighed, to someone, i bellowed 
as an organ
a vital body who 
might have held
all the breath of this 
too late
a night of space 
between the branch
of a branch 
of a sickly and so brittle branch 
peeled,
exposing all that little filth it came from 
and became 
and where it might sit at my keys 
like the heavy oak's goodbye
carved into the welcomed seed
of unpalatable memory--
a family table:

i am forever in your art, and will
to live as long as the wretching fire
that burns your heart to make it 

this body is the work of living 
and dying taught me everything 
there was no body made to hold the weld
together
holding all the eaves of mine
to mine the evening ore 
to drowse from rousing, or 
how all the awe of all this
story left arose 
a bed of rivers 
unforgiving 

i was the children
i could never bear to hold
i do not what to die 
until some body holds my body 
writhing underworked
a covering - i was the stitching of a signature 
in some unread joke, a fiction
to them i wrote
myself out of to hold 
this meaning of a word for how
they could 
not hold 
my pages

there was a voice then, finally 
saying
i was the children -- i was dancing
i was the music -- i was the dancing 
i was the song -- i bled from dancing 
i was the book i wrote myself out of -- dancing
and i was this little story -- tired, i left myself 
i left 
writing
nothing but a story 
that read to me, one bedtime:

Never be afraid to cry 
the sea is grateful for the salt
