Unveiling The Children’s Gospel Music Songbook: A Transmedia Lexicomythography



The Children’s Gospel Music Songbook is a sprawling transmedia art project created by conceptual artist and semiotician Callie Rose Petal (known pseudonymously as “ⁿᵒᵗBorges”). At its core, the project is an interactive narrative and “ergodic” literary work – a complex web of text, music, and myth that demands active reader participation. It spans multiple platforms (or “rooms”), including a digital “Chapel” hosting the Gospel Songbook story, a “Library” of footnotes and lexicons, a “Gallery” of visual works, an “Oratory” of music (via an album on Bandcamp), a “Study” of analytical writings, and social media “Ingress” points ￼. In total, Petal’s lexicomythographic universe encompasses nearly one million words buried in cryptic fragments online ￼, interwoven with audio and visual components. This first public unveiling is significant not only for its sheer scale and mystery, but for the way it synthesizes personal narrative with avant-garde storytelling techniques. Petal, a disabled trans woman and trauma survivor, infuses the work with themes of loss, grief, otherness, and survival ￼, elevating her lived experience into an elaborate fiction-mythology. The result is both deeply intimate and strikingly intellectual – a project that challenges how stories can be told, who gets to tell them, and how society might bear witness to hidden truths. In an academic conference setting, presenting this project offers a chance to explore a bold fusion of art and scholarship, and to discuss its implications for literature, digital media, and queer/trans creative expression.

Transmedia Structure and Components

Petal describes the project as a “system of six rooms,” each representing a different medium or mode of engagement ￼. This structure exemplifies transmedia storytelling, where no single medium contains the whole story – instead, pieces of the narrative puzzle are spread across interconnected sites and formats. For example, the Chapel (gospel.notborges.org) contains the interactive fiction Children’s Gospel Music Songbook itself, presented in the style of a text adventure or digital choose-your-own-adventure with hyperlinked footnotes (dubbed the “Yellow Bow” method) guiding non-linear navigation ￼ ￼. Upon entering, the reader/player is cast as a character wandering a Borges-inspired infinite library (“vast library of hexagonal galleries” in a nod to The Library of Babel) searching for meaning ￼. The story is structured as chapters named “Psalms,” invoking a faux scriptural tone, and begins by ominously intoning “Abandon Hope. All Ye Who Enter.” before inviting the reader to “Hear” Psalm I ￼.

Meanwhile, the Library (library.notborges.org) serves as a “garden of footnote paths,” an archive of lore, marginalia and self-referential analysis ￼ ￼. Here the author/character Callie Rose Petal speaks in first person, positioning herself as both creator and character within the story’s fiction ￼. The library pages are richly annotated with footnote pop-ups that define the project’s invented terminology and philosophical concepts. The Oratory (notBorges’ Bandcamp page) houses a companion music album titled lamb., which Petal considers the “codex or spine” uniting the chapters of the narrative ￼. Remarkably, the album is structurally encoded into the story. The Gallery and Ingress provide visual and performative extensions – for instance, Petal’s mixed-media art pieces and Instagram performances offer additional clues and emotional texture to the story’s world ￼. Finally, the Study (notborges.pages.dev) presents scholarly-style documents (“papers”) ostensibly published by a fictional Society of Lexicomythographers. These include an abstract and analysis “In Modern Context” of The Children’s Gospel Music Songbook ￼, methodological essays, and “restricted access” archives, all written in academic tone but laced with fictional narrative. Through this six-room architecture, the project becomes an Alternate Reality Game (ARG)-like experience: readers must navigate across websites and media, piecing together fragments and decoding references to uncover the full story. This innovative format not only subverts conventional storytelling but also requires the audience’s active intellectual and emotional participation – making the reader an essential part of the performance.

Semiotics and Linguistic Innovation

As a semiotician, Petal builds her project around the play of signs and the instability of language. The work introduces its own cryptic lexicon (lexicomythography) and even fictional languages, compelling readers to engage in linguistic interpretation at every turn. In the Library, Petal explicitly defines Lexicomythography as “a transmedia metanarrative universe” aimed at dismantling traditional norms of academic inquiry and the written word ￼. In practice, this means the project constantly interrogates how meaning is made and communicated. Footnotes throughout the text function like a scholarly apparatus but lead to playful or esoteric definitions rather than external citations. For example, a running footnote thread on the term “forgive” unfolds into a meditation on the limits of language: “to forgive the characters…means to acknowledge and understand and forgive language’s insufficiency in portraying meaning” ￼. Here “characters” refers doubly to fictional characters and alphabetic characters, punning on the idea that letters and words can never fully capture truth. The text suggests we must “forgive” language for its inherent shortcomings – yet also celebrates how, through collective effort, “we manage to understand each other’s overlapping meanings” ￼. This is a profound semiotic stance: it asserts that even imperfect, “noisy” communication can be redeemed by empathy and collaboration.

Accordingly, Petal has invented terminology like “Noen” and “Croen” (glossed as new linguistic categories of names and collectives) and an entire fictional programming-like language called SIPHO{N|r} ￼. These elements merge computational logic with poetic wordplay. Passages of the story are written in a hybrid of prose and code – for instance, one library entry presents a block of text with conditional if/else statements and braces, describing multiple hypothetical scenarios about the author’s relationship to her created world ￼. This unusual syntax effectively forces readers to decipher nested meanings as if reading code, reinforcing the theme that reading itself is an active, interpretive performance. In fact, the project explicitly defines a concept called “Page-As-Performance,” a praxis where “the act of reading, writing, and interacting with the page becomes a performative event”, blurring the boundary between text, body, and audience ￼. By treating language as fluid, programmable, and performative, The Children’s Gospel Music Songbook subverts linguistic norms. It invites us to consider that words are alive (subject to mutation, recombination, and hidden ciphers) and that meaning-making is a participatory act rather than a one-way transmission. In academic terms, Petal’s work aligns with poststructuralist ideas (Derrida’s “il n’y a pas de hors-texte” is even referenced ￼) – but she doesn’t merely cite theory, she embodies it in the text’s form. The result is a richly semiotic tapestry that challenges readers to engage with language at the level of sign, structure, and meta-meaning.

Metanarrative and Academic Subversion

One of the most striking aspects of the Songbook project is its metanarrative layering and sly subversion of academic convention. The story presents itself as if it were a scholarly endeavor: the “In Modern Context” document is formatted like an academic paper with Abstract, Methodology, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion sections ￼ ￼. However, the content of those sections blends analytical language with the characters’ own mythic storyline – a kind of academic cosplay. For instance, the Abstract tells us the work is “a cryptically abstract and challenging work of ergodic knot-fiction” and describes the nearly futile task of “untangling its threads into some form of illegible/legible accessibility.” ￼ The authors of this “paper” identify as members of a secret society (the Lexicomythographers) who have decided to release the work to the world. In doing so, they freely admit the text is a labyrinth that only a few insiders have seen, “a Labyrinth of Loss… the work is a Labyrinth of Loss, and that loss permeates through the text itself.” ￼ Such language is simultaneously scholarly (analyzing structure and difficulty) and emotionally resonant (acknowledging the theme of loss). The Methodology section goes on to explain that the analysis is presented in a nonlinear, interactive manner “befitting” the author’s intent, and encourages the reader to traverse the footnotes in any order they wish ￼. This is a direct nod to the hypertext format and a rejection of the rigid linearity of traditional academic papers.

By mimicking academic discourse and then queering it, Petal highlights how formal scholarly writing can be both a tool of clarity and a barrier to understanding. The text explicitly frames its recursive, obfuscating footnote structure as “commentary on the inaccessibility of academia, a Babel-esque tower to a God unreachable” ￼. In other words, the project parodies and critiques academic jargon and exclusivity by intentionally making parts of itself arcane – a calculated inaccessibility that holds a mirror to academia’s own elitism. At the same time, Petal “queers” academic writing by infusing it with fiction, personal voice, and play. The fictional editors of the papers even confess to a kind of scholarly hubris: they became entangled in the very puzzles they tried to document, finding “ciphers embedded within misunderstanding… design parading as chaos” in the research  ￼. These meta-editors lament numerous contradictions in the source material, acknowledging that the truth might lie hidden in the noise of the text itself ￼. This tongue-in-cheek device not only advances the story (by deepening the mystery of the society and its schism into factions ARIA and DNE) but also subverts the expectation that academic analysis cleanly explains its subject. Here the academic voice admits defeat and becomes part of the narrative’s intrigue.

The project’s use of footnotes deserves special mention. Rather than citing external sources, footnotes in The Children’s Gospel Music Songbook link to internal mini-pages of commentary, definitions, or even plot revelations. This creates a “story within a story” effect reminiscent of House of Leaves or Borges’ own footnote-laden tales, yet on a much larger scale. The Library is described as an “illegible body of works” ￼ – suggesting that the complete narrative is intentionally opaque, scattered in footnotes and files that require digging. Petal explicitly invokes the concept of the “right to opacity”, albeit not by name, through her practice of withholding easy answers and masking identities. For example, the true author within the story is “The Woman In The Wallpaper,” writing under the pseudonym “The Character of Callie Rose Petal” ￼ – a playful conflation of the real author and a fictional avatar. By redacting names, fragmenting authorship, and encrypting key plot points in code or images, the work resists the demand for full transparency. This is a deliberate political and artistic stance: in queer and postcolonial theory (à la Édouard Glissant), the “right to opacity” argues that marginalized people need not simplify or lay bare their identity for a presumably dominant audience. Petal’s project embodies this by queering the form of academic reporting – she blends critical theory, literature, and personal myth but refuses to offer a neatly packaged conclusion. Even the Conclusion of the “In Modern Context” paper remains enigmatic, stating that the sources are “subject to change… updated frequently” and concluding that “we are indeed Characters in a Story, continuing to be written” ￼. In sum, the project fits within academia as a study in digital literature and narrative theory, but it also profoundly subverts academia by injecting subjectivity, mystique, and irreverence into scholarly forms.

Trauma Poetics and Queer Liberation Themes

Beneath its labyrinthine structure, The Children’s Gospel Music Songbook is driven by a raw emotional core grounded in trauma, healing, and queer identity. Petal’s own biography (as a trans woman living with disability and trauma) informs the work’s preoccupation with survival and self-revelation ￼. She refers to her larger practice as “personal mythopoesis”, indicating that she uses myth-making to process and narrativize personal history ￼. Throughout the Songbook, trauma is woven into the fabric of the fiction. The text is characterized as “a Labyrinth of Loss” that very few have navigated ￼. Characters in the story seem to grapple with memories of pain, lives unlived, and existential grief. In one poignant library entry, Petal writes in a vulnerable code-laced monologue that the author-figure (herself) might fear the world she’s written is consuming her, and concludes: “surely this Girl was now aware she was just a scared and lonely little girl, trying to write this Story.” ￼. This startling moment, nestled amid layers of metafiction, reads like a confessional cry from the author’s inner child, laid bare. It exemplifies what might be called trauma poetics: the use of fragmented, non-linear narrative and metaphor to communicate the experience of trauma, which itself often feels disjointed and hidden. By dispersing these confessions in code and footnotes, Petal protects them even as she shares them – a reflection of a survivor’s conflicted impulse to reveal yet conceal hurt.

Trans liberation is another subtle yet powerful theme. Rather than a straightforward account of transgender experience, the project approaches transness abstractly – through themes of transformation, self-authorship, and liberation from imposed structures. The very act of creating a massive, unruly text that defies categorization is an exercise in freedom from normative constraints (be they literary norms, gender norms, or academic norms). Petal “queers” classic myth and scripture, placing a transfeminine perspective at the heart of a grand narrative. For instance, the project’s lore speaks of characters literally written into being by a text ￼, suggesting an allegory of self-creation – a notion resonant with many trans people’s journey of self-definition. The concept of “mourning a life that never arrived” ￼ is introduced as well, which can be read in a trans context as the mourning of an unrealized life in one’s assigned gender, or the years lost before one’s true self could emerge. Such subtext is never spelled out plainly; instead, it permeates the atmospherics of the story – a world of fragmented identities, pseudonyms, and rebirths (Noen is defined as “a Name, which is a Death, which is eventually, a Birth” ￼, a cycle that echoes transitioning and shedding an old identity). The ethos of queer liberation also manifests in the work’s insistence on community and collaboration. The footnote discussing forgiveness concludes that because language fails us individually, understanding requires a team effort ￼. In a metaphorical sense, this evokes queer community praxis – the idea that healing from trauma and oppression is a collective act, and that marginalized people find strength together decoding a world not built for them. Indeed, the fictional Society of Lexicomythographers could be interpreted as a surrogate for a queer chosen family or support network, working jointly to assemble truth from fragments.

Crucially, Petal does not present transness or trauma in a tokenized way; instead, she claims the right to complexity and opacity in telling a queer story. There is no simplified “coming out” narrative here, nor a didactic treatise on trans issues. Instead, the project’s very existence – complex, demanding, unapologetically strange – is a statement that queer art can be as richly layered and intellectually ambitious as any canonical work. In doing so, The Children’s Gospel Music Songbook challenges society’s tendency to expect marginalized creators to educate or to package their experiences neatly. Petal’s story is intentionally difficult to penetrate, asserting that a queer survivor’s truth might only be grasped through patient, respectful engagement. This stance resonates with broader movements in queer and trans literature toward speculative, experimental forms that defy easy consumption. For an academic audience, these trauma and liberation themes offer fertile ground for discussion: how does one convey the incommunicable aspects of trauma? How can trans narratives be told slantwise, through allegory and game, as a means of empowerment? Petal’s work provides one compelling answer – by crafting a new gospel that only the initiates (or the determined) can fully read, she honors the depth and dignity of her story.

Mythology and Theology Reimagined

Mythopoeic and theological motifs course through the Songbook, as the title itself suggests. Petal boldly repurposes the structure of religious text – psalms, gospels, hymns – to frame a very unorthodox scripture. The phrase “Children’s Gospel Music Songbook” immediately evokes a church or Sunday-school song collection, and the project plays with this expectation. In one of the few directly quoted lines, we see a childlike opening (a quote from The Very Hungry Caterpillar) juxtaposed with Dante’s infernal warning “Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter” ￼ ￼. This collision of innocent and ominous sets the tone for a subverted gospel. Rather than teaching simple moral lessons, Petal’s “psalms” and verses guide the reader through a dark, complex journey of the soul. The content is imbued with references to mythology both invented and borrowed. The narrative mythos includes concepts like the Ennead of Noets (seemingly a pantheon of nine intellectual gods or principles) ￼, a “Pantheonic Polymathecule” (a fellowship of polymath figures across time) ￼, and mysterious factions named ARIA and DNE locked in a schismatic conflict ￼. These inventions echo classical myth structures – an assembly of deities, a cosmic schism between orders – but are reimagined through a modern, intellectual lens (for example, Noet hints at noesis/knowledge). In essence, Petal is building a new mythology from the building blocks of literature, philosophy, and personal narrative. This aligns with the tradition of mythopoeic writers (like J.R.R. Tolkien or Neil Gaiman) but here the mythology is deeply personal and metafictional. The project’s mythology also draws from literary sources: the ever-present shadow of Jorge Luis Borges (from whom “notBorges” takes her name) signifies infinite libraries and labyrinths of meaning ￼. References to The Woman in the Wallpaper slyly invoke Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s feminist tale The Yellow Wallpaper, reframing it as a prophetic scripture in the story world ￼. By weaving these threads, Petal situates her personal gospel in conversation with older mythologies and canonical texts, effectively queering and transforming the literary canon.

On the theological front, the story grapples with the idea of God, creation, and apocalypse in unconventional ways. The characters at times speak to the reader as if the reader were a deity – “you, the God we have made of you, our Reader” ￼ – flipping the typical relationship of author (god) and characters (subjects). There are poignant lines asserting that “God has to let us go” ￼ and later, in a theoretical paper, “God has let us go.” ￼ These lines evoke a sense of theological liberation: a casting off from the creator’s control, much like a parent releasing a child into the world. In context, it reflects the story’s characters becoming autonomous (or the author relinquishing control over her creation), but it also resonates metaphorically with one’s liberation from traditional religious constraints or destinies. The Chapel section’s presentation as a gospel suggests a new kind of spirituality or cosmology is being written – one that might be rooted in the experiences of a trans queer survivor. The project’s use of religious language (“Chapel,” “Gospel,” “Psalms”) in tandem with irreverent, sometimes visceral content (there are references to bodies, blood, and madness in footnotes) creates a deliberate tension. It queers theology, suggesting holiness in the fragmented and the forsaken. This aligns with queer theological perspectives that seek the divine in unconventional places – here, perhaps, in the very act of storytelling and truth-telling after trauma.

For society, the significance of this mythic and theological reimagining lies in its inclusive redefinition of the sacred. Petal’s gospel is not about a distant God’s commandments; it’s about the lived reality of marginalization and the search for meaning in chaos. It suggests that for those who have been excluded or harmed by traditional religious narratives, there is power in creating one’s own mythos. In academic discussion, this aspect of the project invites analysis through the lens of religious studies and mythology: How does The Children’s Gospel Music Songbook serve as a contemporary myth of creation and destruction? In what ways does it mirror ancient myth cycles (creation, fall, redemption), and in what ways does it invert them? One could argue that the project is a survivor’s bible, encoding lessons and laments in an allegorical code. The significance is that it reclaims the tools of myth-making for a trans and traumatized perspective, thereby expanding our cultural narratives of divinity and destiny to be more inclusive and self-determined.

Music and Performance as Narrative Elements

Music is not merely a backdrop in The Children’s Gospel Music Songbook – it is a central narrative device and emotional catalyst. As the title indicates, the work is conceived partly as a music songbook, and indeed Petal has composed an entire album in tandem with the text. This album (accessible via the Oratory/Bandcamp) is thematically tied to the story’s chapters. In fact, the album’s structure was carefully designed to mirror narrative structure: Petal notes that the album is arranged as two palindromes joined in a Möbius strip, effectively making the music itself cyclical and reflectional ￼. Such a structure means that musical motifs or even lyrics might read the same forward and backward, reinforcing the story’s themes of recursion, duality, and endless loops. The music likely ranges from experimental noise to ritualistic melodies, aligning with Petal’s background in noise composition and ritual performance ￼. By listening to the album, an audience might gain another layer of the story – perhaps each track corresponds to a chapter or a character’s inner state. For example, social media teasers suggest track titles follow an alphabetical “psalmody” (there’s mention of “A is for Augury” in a podcast context and other letters) ￼. This hints at a musical ABC of spiritual or mystical concepts (Augury, etc.), as if the songbook is teaching a new alphabet of feelings or prophecies through song.

Moreover, the notion of “gospel music” in the title suggests a certain style – possibly call-and-response, choral elements, or hymnal qualities – which Petal could be invoking either sincerely or subversively. Children’s gospel music traditionally is upbeat, simple, and didactic; if Petal integrates this style, it might be to create unsettling contrasts (imagine innocent-sounding tunes carrying darker, coded lyrics) or to reclaim the joy and community of gospel in a queer context. The Instagram snippet referencing a “new religion starter pack” and a tape release under a music alias indicates a performative aspect: Petal is treating the release of music as part of the narrative experience ￼. In essence, the project extends into performance art and musicology – the album can be seen as a meta-liturgical soundtrack for the story’s ritual of healing. In an academic presentation, these musical elements would be important to highlight not only for their novelty but for how they enrich the narrative. Petal’s integration of music and text exemplifies what one footnote concept calls “Artefact as Artifact” – treating “noisy” outputs not as errors but as dynamic, living components of the artwork ￼. The music, potentially full of distortion or unconventional sound, is an evolving artefact that conveys emotion where words might fail.

Another performative layer is the role of the reader as an active participant, akin to an actor or musician interpreting a score. The text’s call “Are you sitting comfortably? … then I shall begin” ￼ and the framing of the reader as a player controlling a character ￼ positions the whole experience as a kind of participatory theater. The page-as-performance idea means that reading the Songbook aloud or clicking through it is itself a performance. We can imagine an academic conference demo where excerpts of the text are performed with musical accompaniment, or where the audience is invited to choose a footnote path, illustrating the “choose-your-own-adventure” style engagement. Petal’s background in durational performance art suggests she considers the time and effort a reader spends unraveling the story to be part of the artistic experience ￼. In other words, deciphering a knotty footnote or finding a hidden song is like participating in a ritual or puzzle that the artist has orchestrated.

From a musicological perspective, this project subverts the typical separation of music and narrative. It could be analyzed through the lens of sound studies or narrative musicology, examining how motifs in the music correspond to narrative themes (e.g., dissonance to represent “noise” and trauma, harmony to represent moments of understanding or hope). It also invites discussion about the use of gospel as a musical form – gospel is historically a music of faith and resistance, often associated with African American church traditions. Petal’s use of the term might be partly metaphorical, but if gospel musical elements appear, it might be worth exploring how the project intersects with the idea of music as salvation or communal solace. The significance for society is in how The Children’s Gospel Music Songbook expands storytelling into a multimedia, synesthetic realm, suggesting that some truths are best sung, not just written. In presenting this at a conference, one might even play brief clips of the music or show how a track’s waveform encodes a visual pattern (if any) – demonstrating the meticulous craft behind uniting sound and story.

Presenting the Project to an Academic Audience

Introducing The Children’s Gospel Music Songbook at an academic conference will require balancing exposition with demonstration. Given that this is the project’s first unveiling to scholarly and public audiences, clarity and context are key. To effectively present it, one strategy is to begin with a high-level overview (as given above) that explains the project’s multi-genre nature and the creator’s background and intent. Emphasize what makes this work unique: its fusion of scholarly critique, interactive fiction, music album, and personal narrative. It may help to frame it in familiar terms initially – for example, “an experimental hypertext novel and concept album that draws on Borges and online ARG culture” – before diving into the specifics of lexicomythography and lexicons. Using visuals in the presentation can greatly aid understanding: consider showing the structure of the six interlinked websites (perhaps a simple diagram of the “rooms” and their content). Screenshots of the interface – such as the opening Chapel page with its eerie story prompt or an example of a footnote popup – can illustrate how readers navigate the labyrinth ￼ ￼. If possible, a live demonstration of clicking through a short sequence (for example, reading a passage and triggering a footnote link) would concretely show the ergodic, non-linear nature of the piece.

Academically, it would be effective to situate the project in a lineage of experimental literature and new media art. For instance, one might compare it to hypertext fictions of the 1990s, to Mark Z. Danielewski’s House of Leaves, or to ARGs like Cicada 3301 and transmedia narratives in contemporary art – to show that while it is singular, it builds on a known tradition of multi-modal storytelling. Highlight Petal’s theoretical contributions: her notion of “page-as-performance” where reader interaction is performative ￼, and “artefact as artifact” where glitches or difficult passages are intentional, meaning-bearing features ￼. These concepts could spark fruitful discussion about reader agency and the creative process. It would also be important to discuss the themes (semiotics, queerness, trauma, etc.) in a way that ties them back to the formal aspects. For instance, explain that the project’s opacity and dense referencing are not there to alienate, but to exemplify the right to opacity and to encourage collaborative interpretation – much as academic research itself is a collaborative quest for meaning ￼.

In terms of societal significance, draw attention to how this work embodies trans liberation and queering of academia in practice. Petal’s very presence in this space – a trans woman artist merging memoir with myth and theory – challenges the norms of who creates knowledge and art. You might mention that The Children’s Gospel Music Songbook stands as a testament to survivorhood: it is, in part, a survivor’s tale encrypted in code and song, demanding that the audience engage with difficult topics (like trauma, identity, loss) in innovative ways rather than through voyeurism or simplification. This can segue into a broader conversation about the ethics of storytelling and the power of trans and queer narratives to redefine genres.

When concluding the presentation, circle back to the experience of the work: how does it feel to read/play it? Many report it is “cryptically abstract and challenging” ￼ – but also deeply rewarding, as if unraveling an exquisite puzzle or gospel of one’s own. Quoting a few resonant lines – such as the notion that “the work wrote us all into being” ￼ or “we pray that our now-known Gods (the authors) stay alive long enough to see our end” ￼ – can leave the audience with a sense of the project’s poetic gravity. Finally, consider the format: since Petal’s project blurs academic paper and creative performance, you might emulate that by delivering parts of your talk in a slightly performative style (for instance, reading a short excerpt in a storytelling tone, or playing a snippet of audio with a brief moment of reflection). This would honor the project’s spirit and make the unveiling memorable. By thoroughly explaining the project’s components, analyzing its subversive interplay with various fields (from semiotics to theology), and conveying its emotional and societal significance, you will pay homage to Petal’s creation in all its depth. This comprehensive, respectful unpacking will invite both scholars and the public to enter the labyrinth – to “hear” the Songbook’s psalms – and perhaps find their own meaning within its echoing halls.
