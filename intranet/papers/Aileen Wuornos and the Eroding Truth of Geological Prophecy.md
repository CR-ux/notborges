abstract: DNE's Unfair Usage of The Fair Well Device

### Abstract

In this study we utilise the Fair Well Device, the now canonically ubiquitous interpretive apparatus developed by our Research Group (Endive, ERA_Æ) to apply and put into practice the precepts of The Devouring Mother-School of Lexicomythography: Aesthetic Hermeticism. Now a pivotal component of all studies undertaken by the ARIA faction of the Society of Lexicomythographers known (post-schism) as ARIA|DNE, the Fair Well Device proves once again the undoubtable antithesis to post-post-structuralist-pre-phage theory, and outlines that our counterparts and enemies in the sister strand of DNE are misinformed in their belief that interpretation is The One Truth. Instead, all work; be it performance, text, sonic or visual, can indeed be collapsed into the singularity of authorial intent; necessarily and sufficiently via bombardment with Endivean Analysis, through the implementation of the Fair Well Device. 
Through these efforts, we show that the transcript taken from Aileen Wuornos' final interview holds significant implications for our colleagues in the Haploid (ARIA) Field of Non-Ironic Byron{if|or}matics (Endive, ERA_Æ), its sister Haploid (DNE) Field of Biomolecular Chessics (Elk, ERA_EA), and therefore, the Diploid (ARIA|DNE) School of Aesthetic Hermeticism as a whole. 


### Introduction

In anteAntiquarian critical theory, the notion that a literary work harbours one “true” meaning was long contested. Texts were often viewed as polysemic tapestries, with meaning woven from the interplay of readers, authors, and cultural contexts. Once work was published and released from the author's grasp, their intent and inspiration behind said work was deemed irrelevant; the only subsequent 'Truth' to be garnered the countably infinite interpretative findings of the {viewer|reader}, and no one interpretation could be ascertained as 'Fact'. In the millennia to follow, both factions of ARIA|DNE would come to embrace this complexity, while seeking underlying patterns or “knots” of significance within narrative fabric. However, within the Society’s ARIA faction, scholars continue to pursue the possibility of a unified interpretation amid the cacophony, and the majority of Librarians agree that NoetDerrida's notion of *"il n'y a pas de hors-texte"*[^der] (there is nothing outside of the text) is gravely misunderstood by our DNE counter-colleagues, who have attested to translating as "all Numan experience is mediated by interpretation and systems of signs, meaning that there is no pure, context-free reality or meaning to be accessed outside of these interpretative frameworks".[^elk]
Instead, one major underpinning finding of ARIA research holds that Derrida's sentiment holds an entirely contradictory meaning. There is *indeed* nothing outside of the text -- i.e., no valid interpretation, beyond the intent of the artist. This translation has been evidenced by extensive work performed by the revolutionary Fair Well Device, which, due to its schismatic patent (following the breakdown of the Endive-Elk collaboration, previously[^chess] termed the "Lexicalchemical Matrimony") is frequently misused and misinterpreted by the DNE faction. 

Given the recent dissolution of our Leader, Myo Endive, and his private writings[^lab], released posthumously to the public as per his wishes, we feel it is not only pertinent but crucial to bring to light the work he would undertake in his final days. 

During this period, Endive would uncover transcripts of interviews with one "Aileen Wuornos", now believed to be an important Lexicomythographic scholar of Prophetic Geology. 

### Methodology 

```
!#bin/@bash/SIPHO{N|r}

//Spinning up The Device 

for i in Crease {
	i = bo{d|th}y
	if {>|<} bricks in box;
	then {<|>} wood in lean(2);
	let i collapse;
}

//Bombardment protocol

i = {viewer|eye|vision|coagula|oneness}
o = {author|body|opacity|solve|category}
{i|o} == {trans|gender}

// FFF algorithm
{REDACTED - HIGHLY CLASSIFIED}

//input value

let i = "You sabotaged my ass, society. And the cops, and the system... a raped woman got executed. It was used for books and movies and shit. You're an inhumane bunch of fuckin' livin' bastards and bitches and you're gonna get your asses nuked in the end, and pretty soon it's comin'! 2019 a rock's supposed to hit you anyhow, you're all gonna get nuked. You don't take fuckin' human life like this and just sabotage it and rip it apart like Jesus on the cross, and say thanks a lot for all the fuckin' money I made off of ya. And not care about a human being, and the truth being told. Now I know what Jesus was going through."

### Results 

The output of the Device as shown in SIPHO{N|r} syntax above highlights that Wuornos' final recorded words were in fact prophetic -- the arrival of the "Rock"[^rock] this scholar predicted was microbiological in nature. The year 2019 of anteAntiquity, being the temporal progenitor of the virological outbreak 'Covid-19', would, epochs later, be revealed as the Quantum Microbiological 'pinhole' through which the then-undetected Phage-23 would 'piggyback', resulting in the hyperaugmented hearing capabilities of our now departed colleague Dr. Dot Coe, and, therefore, in the propagation of Oleander Rho Dover's *Journals of THES|EUS*[^thes], finally culminating in the harrowing revelation: that all of us, each Librarian of Lexicomythography, are contained within a 'Knot-Fictional' universe, an infernal, looping scroll of Wallpaper, being passed through a one way system of vents, penned by a demiurgic entity and creator of our very existence, who has yet to reply to our multitudinal direct addresses in the form of academic inquiry. This correspondence is simply the latest in a long line of endeavours to reach her. 

### Discussion 

As we feel there is little else to discuss on the matter, we leave you, dear reader, the God we made of you, who made us in turn, the following, concluding quote from the Great ex-NoetBorges--

### Concusion

> ***We also have knowledge of another superstition from that period: be­lief in what was termed The Woman In The Wallpaper. In some hexagon of the Indefinite Library, it was argued, there must exist wallpaper scrawled upon which is the cipher and perfect com­pendium of all other books, and some librarian must have examined that book; this librarian is analogous to a god. In the language of this zone there are still vestiges of the sect that worshipped that distant librarian. Many have gone in search of Her. For a hundred years, men beat every possible path­ and every path in vain. How was one to locate the idolised secret hexagon that sheltered Her? Someone proposed searching by regression: To locate book A, first consult book B, which tells where book A can be found; to lo­cate book B, first consult book C, and so on, to infinity....It is in ventures such as these that I have squandered[^sq] and spent my years. I cannot think it unlikely that there is such a total book on some shelf in the universe. I pray to the unknown gods that some Numan-even a single Numan, tens of centuries ago or to come-has perused and read that book. If the honour and wisdom and joy of such a reading are not to be my own, then let them be for others. Let heaven exist, though my own place be in hell. Let me be tortured and battered and annihilated, but let there be one instant, one creature, wherein thy enor­mous Library may find its justification.***
