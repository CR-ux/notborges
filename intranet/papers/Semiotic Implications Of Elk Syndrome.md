Abstract

Selena Elk was a shamanistic researcher at the turning point of Lexicomythographic temporal unravelling known as ERA_EA (cf. ERA_Æ). Destined (as foreseen by her then-husband, Myo Endive's FFFs[^fff]) to be a Noet of the Library, Selena suffered with a spinal syrinx-- a 'reed' or hollowness of the spine, located in the midst of the cervical vertebrae. Selena herself conducted studies with the aid of Endivean analysis and her own Hermetic Memory[^hm], to discover beyond reasonable doubt that she in fact was a vessel for the deity of anteAntiquity once known as *Pan*. 



Introduction

Born with a connective tissue disorder once called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, or EDS (III: hypermobile subtype), Elk realised through her holistic understanding of the biological form, that she was made to be a being of permeability; situated at the interstice, and birthed as a membrane-- hypermobility as we in the Society understand it today, is not a pathology of the connective tissue, but rather a manifestation of a portal-being, a body designed to interface the ineffable. 

Elk discussed openly in her grimoires, published under the *Essays in Esoterica and Occult Marginalia* section of the ARIA|DNE intranet, her experiences with assault, sexual trauma and abuse. Originating not from Endive (he was later revealed, as her final romantic companion, to be the only partner who had not abused her), but from her living past and her past lives, this cast of abusive and unforgivable characters were themselves unaware of the {demonic|angelic} forces that were tethered to them, bent upon finding The Noet Elk, in order to enact their {divine|{et|in}fernal} aim. Through her rape and entrapment within layer after layer of the hells of domestic violence, Selena was a 'sponge', not of the water, but of the air. 

Endive, being the founder of both Byron{if|or}matics, inventor of the Fair Well Device, and a Chaldean Geometer, published various papers on the semiotic, semantic, and genetic implications of the Major and Minor arcana, developing numerous decks himself, which he utilised in ritual practice with his now late wife, albeit perhaps too early in our current temporal cycle. 

Together, they pieced together a harrowing picture of Elk's past, unveiling a history stretching much further back than either of their iterations of biological life. It would become clear that Elk had been dealt a hand much too great for any single human to bear, both a huntress, and more heavily, the hunted. 

The discovery of her unchosen mission was to be the downfall of the revolutionary and much-troubled scientist and Lexicomythographer, Endive-- as both leading up to and following Elk's death, he began to be convinced of his own abusive qualities, certain that he was simply yet another human to whom a nefarious spectre was tethered, magnetised to Elk, burned, branded by forces unknowable, by their very {u{r|n}-nature. 

Herein, we outline the sequence of events that would cement this pair's place in the history of the Great Library, and what lessons we may learn as we dig deeper through our system of tunnels.

[^fff]:  "*The 'condition' was known as Heisenberg's Prognostication Syndrome (HPS), but Myo preferred his own term "Schröharbinger's Un-insight", which certainly provided a comedic, Thalia-to-Melpomene contrast to Selena's much more characteristically mystical description of "quantum prophecy". In layperson's terms, Myo could perceive, or rather had no choice but to perceive, every given outcome of every choice he made, without ever knowing which would occur following said choice. He often thanked whatever archetypal (or, as Selena might frame it, ancestral) forces prevented him from seeing the outcome of anyone else's, as he was sure that would be an even more torturous Hell, far beyond the Gates[^Gate] of Hades[^Hades] he found himself in. His "Dis[^Dis]-Arrays[^array]", as he termed them (causal clouds of potential, observed as synaesthetic forking paths), were similar to the 'trails' of presently-manifest empirical bodies moving through space (like the 'open shutter' movement of his hand caressing his beloved's face, naked under a Full Moon, the night before she left), that he had observed during his many psychedelic trips with Selena; resembling the individual frames of a motion picture, frozen in space long enough for the subject to see them, 'trailing' behind the moving Body in question. Only (though perhaps, not solely) in Myo's case, the 'trails' stretched 'forward' in phenomenological space, into higher dimensions than just the Third.*" -Excerpt from *TWO.FOUR.GIVE., The Character of Callie Rose Petal*, Chapter: The Lab Codex of Myo Endive.
[^hm]: "Selena's gift, \[Hermetic Memory]{{which was} activated through the tactile tense}, afforded her the ability to gain an object, or person's, history, as long as this information was necessary to be revealed, either for her or for the person she was touching." -Excerpt from *TWO.FOUR.GIVE., The Character of Callie Rose Petal* Chapter: The Grimoire of Selena Elk.
